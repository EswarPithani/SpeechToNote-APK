# SpeechToNote-APK using Google Speech To Text API
This is a multi-user authenticated speech to text converting app.The main key features of this app is to convert the input user speech into text in pdf format in which user is asked to set the pdf name after recording and user can see the recorded pdfs history in the app. In this I used python flask as backend communication and creation of this is fully based on the java in android studio.
